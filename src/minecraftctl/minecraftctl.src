version:            The name of the Minecraft server that was set via systemctl.
                    For example, minecraft@b1.7.3.service has the name 'b1.7.3'.

command:            One of start, stop, reload or attach or a Minecraft command.

    start:          Start the server. Used by systemd.

    stop:           Stop the server and close the tmux session. Note that
                    depending on the minecraft@.service configuration, systemd
                    may restart the server once the process exits.

    restart:        Stop then start the server to reload configuration.

    attach:         Attach to the version's tmux socket.

    snapshot:         Snapshot the world's levelname. Used by cron.

    Note that the Minecraft command can be sent as any number of words. It can
    optionally be surrounded in quotes."
